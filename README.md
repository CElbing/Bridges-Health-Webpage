# ⚕️Bridges Health Webpage

This project was developed by myself and two fellow students at my college. We were part of a class title
Human and Computer Interaction, where we learned about the processes of creating accessible and user
friendly applications. In this class we had the opportunity of working with Bridges Health Winona 
(BHW) to help reconstruct some aspects of their webiste and potenitally have our features included
on their website in final production. 

## STAR Breakdown

### Situation
I was assigned to work with two other students to help reconstruct Bridges Health Winona's website.

### Task
We were tasked with developing a donation button, social media integration, and later on in the
project they requested a login system. My specific contribution was handling the HTML, CSS,
donation button, and eventually the login system. Gavin informed us that they also had hired a 
company to redesign the website, but was still looking for interesting features to be included 
in the web page.

### Action
In order to ensure my group was completing tasks as expected by BHW I needed to communicate with their 
representative, Gavin, through email to provide updates, discuss design decisions, and gather their desired 
content. I almost created an exact replica of the styles used for the web page by the development company as 
well as HTML elements such as the header, nav bar, and footer. The donation button was quite simple and linked 
to what was supposed to be a Stripe payment handler, but they never provided the proper link as it wasn't
fully set up yet. So the button links to the Stripe homepage instead. The login system was developed
using PHP, and was ment to represent what the login system could look like. I did not have the secruity
knoweldge or understanding to create a proper system to handler logins, so I created a JSON file to store the 
username and hashed password. The login system allows users to log in and it brings them to a protected page.

### Result
As a result we developed a webpage containing features in a style aligning within the client's expectations. 
Sadly none of the features developed by my group, or any other group, got added to their website. Despite this, 
I learned a lot of HTML and CSS and how to recreate designs using these language and how to communicate 
professionally with a client through email.
